# RiderKick
This gem provides helper interfaces and classes to assist in the construction of application with
Clean Architecture, as described in [Robert Martin's seminal book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134494164).

    $ rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
    $ rails g model models/products name price:decimal is_published:boolean 
    $ rails generate rider_kick:structure Models::Product actor:owner
    $ rails generate rider_kick:scaffold products scope:dashboard

## Philosophy

The intention of this gem is to help you build applications that are built from the use case down,
and decisions about I/O can be deferred until the last possible moment.

## Clean Architecture
This structure provides helper interfaces and classes to assist in the construction of application with Clean Architecture, as described in Robert Martin's seminal book.

```
- app
  - models
    - models
      - ...
  - domains 
    - core
      ...
        - entities (Contract Response)
        - builder
        - repositories (Business logic)
        - use_cases (Just Usecase)
        - utils (Class Reusable)
```
## Screaming architecture - use cases as an organisational principle
Uncle Bob suggests that your source code organisation should allow developers to easily find a listing of all use cases your application provides. Here's an example of how this might look in a this application.
```
- app
  - models
    - models
      - ...
  - domains 
    - core
      ...
      - usecase
        - retail_customer_opens_bank_account.rb
        - retail_customer_makes_deposit.rb
        - ...
```
Note that the use case name contains:

- the user role
- the action
- the (sometimes implied) subject
```ruby
    [user role][action][subject].rb
    # retail_customer_opens_bank_account.rb
    # admin_fetch_info.rb [specific usecase]
    # fetch_info.rb [generic usecase] every role can access it
```
